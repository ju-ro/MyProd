   Come with me
Into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let the hours pass
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Let's get away
Just for one day
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
(Let me hear you speaking
Just for me)
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
(Let me hear you crying
Just for me)
Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Metropolis
There's nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
(Let me hear you speaking
Just for me)
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
(Let me hear you crying
Just for me)
Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
(Let me hear you crying
Just for me)
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
(Let me hear you crying
Just for me)
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
(Let me hear you crying
Just for me)
